## 1. Permissions

The creators of the Work (“The Licensor”) grant permission
to any person, group or legal entity that doesn't violate the prohibitions below (“The User”),
to do everything with the Work that would otherwise infringe their copyright or any patent claims,
subject to the following conditions:

## 2. Obligations

The User must give appropriate credit to the Licensor,
provide a copy of this license, and indicate whether and what kind of changes were made.
The User may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the User or their use.
The User must also provide some form of link to the original Work.
Users who do not meet the exceptions in Section 8. Exceptions must affirm that LGBTQ+ rights are human rights and not
contradict this statement. Users who do meet the exceptions must not contradict that LGBTQ+ rights are human rights.

## 3. Prohibitions

No one may use the Work for prejudiced or bigoted purposes, including but not limited to:
racism, xenophobia, queerphobia, queer exclusionism, homophobia, transphobia, enbyphobia, misogyny.

No one may use the Work to inflict or facilitate violence or abuse of human rights,
as defined in either of the following documents:
[Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights),
[European Convention on Human Rights](https://prd-echr.coe.int/web/echr/european-convention-on-human-rights)
along with the rulings of the [European Court of Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/).

No entity that commits such abuses or materially supports entities that do
may use the Work for any reason.

No law enforcement, carceral institutions, immigration enforcement entities, military entities, or military contractors
may use the Work for any reason. This also applies to any individuals employed by those entities.

No business entity where the ratio of pay (salaried, freelance, stocks, or other benefits)
between the highest and lowest individual in the entity is greater than 50 : 1
may use the Work for any reason.

No private business with more than a thousand employees may use the Work for any reason.

Unless the User has made substantial changes to the Work,
or uses it only as a part of a new work also licensed under the license (eg. as a library, as a part of an anthology, etc.),
they are prohibited from selling the Work. These modified works must carry a different name from the original project (i.e.
"(project name)-xyz").

No machine learning models used for profit by a business entity are permitted to be trained upon the Work.

## 4. Requirements to Adopt

To be able to legally adopt this license, the Licensor should not be a Prohibited Entity. If the Licensor fails to meet any
of the criteria, then they should cease usage of the license. The Work should be considered "Open Source", by the definition
that "Open Source" means that all files required to execute the program (or create an executable via compilation) are publicly
available without payment, compensation, or any form of restrictions not stated in this license. These files do not include
any form of intermediate representation used by a compiler, nor deliberately obfuscated source code.

## 5. Sanctions

If the Licensor makes the User aware that they have not complied with the rules of the license, they can keep their license by
complying within 30 days. If they do not do so, their license ends immediately.

## 6. Warranty

This Work is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
The Licensor will not be liable to anyone for any damages related to the Work or this license,
under any kind of legal claim as far as the law allows.

## 7. Acceptance

By using the Work, the entity using immediately enters a legally binding contract with the Licensor to follow this
license. If any of the prohibitions (defined in Section 3. Prohibitions) or obligations (defined in Section 2.
Obligations) of this license are violated, then see Section 5. Sanctions.

## 8. Exceptions

Exceptions to certain clauses are in place for CI systems, package repositories, packaging systems, and any entity the
Licensor chooses. The Licensor may make exceptions to sell produced binaries as long as the code is still Open Source
as defined in Section 4. Requirements to Adopt. The Licensor may also grant any other license to specific entities
(for example, package repositories). The Licensor may also, at any time and for any reason, revoke another license.
